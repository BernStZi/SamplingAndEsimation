# Sampling and Estimation
## A lecture with tutorial about sampling and estimation in the field of sample surveys. 

The lecture is split into three part.

Part 1 ([Browser](https://github.com/BernStZi/SamplingAndEstimation/blob/master/GESISsusc2015_Day1.pdf) | 
[Download](https://github.com/BernStZi/SamplingAndEstimation/raw/short/lecture/GESISsusc2015_Day1.pdf))
covers the concept of sampling from a finite population. The depiction of estimation and inference is driven  **sampling design** that was used in selecting the sample. **Simple Random Sampling** is explained as one of the most basic sampling designs. Then **stratfication** of the surveyed population is introduced as one of the most common elements of sampling designs.

Part 2 ([Browser](https://github.com/BernStZi/SamplingAndEstimation/blob/master/GESISsusc2015_Day2.pdf) | 
[Download](https://github.com/BernStZi/SamplingAndEstimation/raw/short/lecture/GESISsusc2015_Day2.pdf))
introduces features of more **complex sampling designs** that however find often application in sampling surveys.
These features include **cluster sampling**, **mutlistage sampling** and **sampling with unequal inclusion probabilities**.
**Design effects** are also discussed as a measure of comparing the efficiency of sampling and estimation strategies.

Part 3 ([Browser](https://github.com/BernStZi/SamplingAndEstimation/blob/master/GESISsusc2015_Day3.pdf) | 
[Download](https://github.com/BernStZi/SamplingAndEstimation/raw/short/lecture/GESISsusc2015_Day3.pdf))
Focuses of **survey weights** for the estimation of population statistics. Their usage is motivated to both reduce sampling and non-sampling error with the help of auxiliary information. Three methods to produce survey weights are presented, **post-stratification**, **raking** and the **generalized regression estimator**.
The implications of using survey on doing statistical inference are also shown.


The tutorial consists of exercises in which students will apply the methodology covered in the lecture using the R language. The exercise is also split into three parts

Part 1 
Part 2
Part 3

If you are new to R there you will find a document [here](https://github.com/BernStZi/SamplingAndEstimation/blob/short/excercise/preparation/Preparation.md), which you might find helpful in guiding you through your first steps in R and gives you hints on where to find further information.
