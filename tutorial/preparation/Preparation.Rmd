## Introduction

This document can be used for the preparation to the GRADE- workshop "Sampling and Estimation" at the University of Frankfurt. Hints for further reading are embedded at the end of each section.

## Why use R?

There are several arguments for the use of R as a tool for sampling and estimation:

- [Rapid implementation](https://opensource.com/business/14/12/r-open-source-language-data-science) of new (scientific) developments

- [Quick development](http://r4stats.com/articles/popularity/) of new tools that fit the user's demand

- Over 5,000 [packages](http://www.r-statistics.com/2013/06/top-100-r-packages-for-2013-jan-may/) contributed by users available on [CRAN](http://mirrors.softliste.de/cran/)

- [Open Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software) - You can create your own objects, functions and packages

- [Reproducibility](http://www.r-bloggers.com/rs-role-in-science-breakthrough-reproducibility-of-psychology-studies/)


More arguments for the usage of R can be found [here](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/07/technology/business-computing/07program.html?_r=2&) or [here](http://www.revolutionanalytics.com/what-r).


## How to get R?

R can be installed on Windows and Linux plattforms as well as on Macs. If you have not done it already please download R from [here](http://mirrors.softliste.de/cran/).

The installation process should be straightforward. If you have problems you can read an [introduction](http://a-little-book-of-r-for-time-series.readthedocs.org/en/latest/src/installr.html) or watch an intro on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cX532N_XLIs).

## Rstudio

The basic R looks like this:

![Ralt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BernStZi/SamplingAndEsimation/master/excercise/figure/Ralt.png)

Most R-users prefer the graphical user interface ([GUI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface))

Several [GUI's](http://www.statmethods.net/interface/guis.html) are available. In this course we will use the Rstudio [GUI](www.rstudio.com) which can be downloaded [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/RStudio/#Desktop).

![pic](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BernStZi/SamplingAndEstimation/short/excercise/figure/rstudio2.PNG)


- How to install Rstudio ( [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFfRQuQKGYg) | [dummies](http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/how-to-install-and-configure-rstudio.html))

## First operations

If you work with R you should work with scripts that should be [well structured](http://nicercode.github.io/blog/2013-04-05-projects/) and lucid. To re-use scripts it is necessary to comment the code with hashes: 

```{r}
# Comments 
```

Create [new variables](http://www.statmethods.net/management/variables.html) with the assignment operator `<-`:

```{r}
x <- 1 # numeric
y <- "a" # string
z <- T # logical
```


The following line creates a vector with ten standard-normal-distributed values.

```{r}
x <- rnorm(10,0,1)
```

`rnorm` is a function which takes several arguments. More information on assignments can be found [here](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-intro.html#Vectors-and-assignment).

## Functions

```{r}
mean(x)
```

calculates the mean of variable x


More basic commands:

```{r}
length(x)
max(x)
min(x)
sd(x)
var(x)
median(x)
```

## Errors and Warnings

If an error occurs - you have to fix it:

```{r,eval=T,error=TRUE}
1/"a"
```

```{r}
a <- 5 
1/a
```

You should always read the warnings, but sometimes you can ignore them:
```{r}
a <- c(1,2,3)
b <- c(4,5)
cbind(a,b)
```


## Getting help

Countless introductions to R are available. The manuals on CRAN are comprehensive. 

- [Introduction to R](http://mirrors.softliste.de/cran/doc/manuals/r-release/R-intro.html#Introduction-and-preliminaries)

- [Thomas Girke - Programming in R](http://manuals.bioinformatics.ucr.edu/home/programming-in-r)

- A collection of tutorial videos can be found [here](http://jeromyanglim.blogspot.de/2010/05/videos-on-data-analysis-with-r.html) 

For more specific questions and solutions e.g. in respect of error messages it is useful to use a [search engine](https://duckduckgo.com/). Alternatively forums like [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r) can be used. 

If you have problems to find the commands use a [reference card](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Short-refcard.pdf)

A basic help is always embedded in R. Get the help page for a command:

```{r,eval=F}
help.start()

help(mean)

  # if you know already the function name:
?mean
```

Often you can get examples like the following one for linear regression.
  
```{r,eval=F}
example(lm)
```


## Draw random numbers:

In the following three different functions are used to draw random numbers:

```{r}
  # Uniform Distribution
x1 <- runif(1000)
  # Normal distribution
x2 <- rnorm(1000)
  # Exponential distribution
x3 <- rexp(1000)

rnorm(20,mean=0,sd=1)
```


## Installing and Loading Packages

Many functions are already implemented in basic R. For more specific tasks libraries/packages have to be installed. This can be done using the command `install.packages`. After the installation the package must be loaded with the command `library`.

```{r,eval=F}
install.packages("sampling")
library("sampling")
```

Here is a list of packages which are relevant for the workshop:

- [foreign](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/foreign/index.html) - Read Data Stored by Minitab, S, SAS, SPSS, Stata, Systat, Weka, dBase, ...

- [sampling](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sampling/index.html) - Survey Sampling

- [survey](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/survey/index.html) - analysis of complex survey samples

- [plyr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/plyr/index.html) - Tools for Splitting, Applying and Combining Data

- [Matrix](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Matrix/index.html) - Sparse and Dense Matrix Classes and Methods

```{r,eval=F}
install.packages("foreign")
install.packages("lattice")
install.packages("survey")
install.packages("plyr")
install.packages("Matrix")
```

A list on the most popular R-packages can be found [here](http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2013/06/a-list-of-r-packages-by-popularity.html).

## Indexing

[Indexing](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-lang.html#Indexing) is an important concept, e.g. to select subgroups. In the following the indexing for the different [data types](http://www.statmethods.net/input/datatypes.html) are presented.

First indexing for vectors:

```{r}
A1 <- c(1,2,3,4)
A1
A1[1]
A1[4]
A1[1:3]
A1[-4]
```

Indexing for dataframes:

```{r}
AA <- 4:1
A2 <- cbind(A1,AA)
A2[1,1]
A2[2,]
A2[,1]
A2[,1:2]
```

Indexing for arrays:

```{r}
A3 <- array(1:8,c(2,2,2))
A3
A3[,,2]
```

Indexing for list's:

```{r}
A4 <- list(A1,1)
A4
A4[[2]]
```

## Sequences

```{r}
# sequence from 1 to 10
1:10

seq(-2,8,by=1.5)

a<-seq(3,12,length=12)

b<- seq(to=5,length=12,by=0.2)

d <-1:10
d<- seq(1,10,1)
d <- seq(length=10,from=1,by=1)

# replicate 1 10 times
rep(1,10)
rep("A",10)
```



## [Basic Visualisations](http://www.statmethods.net/graphs/)

The plot function is the easiest option to get a graphic:

```{r}
x <- rnorm(1000,0,1)
plot(x)
```

Adding a header:

```{r}
plot(x,main="header")
```



If we want a histogram, we can use the following command:

```{r}
hist(x)
```




## The sample function

Usage of the command [sample](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/sample.html)

![pic](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BernStZi/SamplingAndEsimation/master/excercise/figure/SampleWhat.PNG)

![pic](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BernStZi/SamplingAndEsimation/master/excercise/figure/SampleHow.PNG)

![pic](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BernStZi/SamplingAndEsimation/master/excercise/figure/SampleReplacement.PNG)

```{r}
sample(x=1:10,1)
sample(x=1:10,1,replace=T)
```


## Working Directory and Workspace

Declaring a working directory (you need to tell R where your data is saved). 

```{r,eval=F}
path<-"C:/"

setwd(path)

getwd()

dir()
```


- It is always useful to define and set your working directory at the beginning of each script
- `getwd()` displays you your current working directory
- `dir()` shows you all objects in a specific directory
- `ls()` lists all objects in your workspace
- `rm()` removes a object from your workspace


```{r,eval=F}
rm(list = ls()) # deletes all objects in your current workspace
```

## [Data Import and Export in R](http://science.nature.nps.gov/im/datamgmt/statistics/r/fundamentals/index.cfm)

Some datasets are implemented in R-packages:

```{r,message=F,warning=F}
library("sampling")
data(belgianmunicipalities)
```

```{r,eval=F}
head(belgianmunicipalities)
```

```{r,echo=F}
kable(belgianmunicipalities[1:8,1:5])
```

Also foreign datasets can be imported:

```{r}
link <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BernStZi/
SamplingAndEstimation/master/excercise/data/my.pop.csv"

my.pop <- read.csv(link)
```

```{r,eval=F}
head(my.pop)
```


```{r,echo=F}
kable(head(my.pop))
```



In the following the European Social Survey (ESS) data will be used. The data can be downloaded [here](http://www.europeansocialsurvey.org/data/round-index.html).
We can import spss data using the command `read.spss` from R-package `foreign`.

```{r,echo=F,eval=F}
data.path <- "D:/Daten/Daten/DatenSonst/"
data.path2 <- "J:/Work/Statistik/Kolb/Workshops/2016/grade_sampling/data"
setwd(data.path)
# setwd(data.path2)
```

```{r,eval=F}
library(foreign)
ESS7 <- read.spss("ESS7e01.sav",to.data.frame=T)
```

As default the data is imported as a list but it is more convenient to work with `data.frames`. Therefore we have to specify in a further argument, that we want to work with a `data.frame`.

With the package `foreign`it is also possible to import stata-data:

```{r,eval=F}
library(foreign)
ESS7s <- read.dta("ESS7e01.dta")
```


In the first example a country file and sample data for Sweden will be needed.

```{r,eval=F}
library(foreign)
ESS5_SE <- read.spss("ESS5_SE_SDDF.por",
                     to.data.frame=T)
```



Some Links on import and export of data in R:

- [Quick-R on importing data](http://www.statmethods.net/input/importingdata.html)

- [Quick-R on exporting data](http://www.statmethods.net/input/exportingdata.html)


## [Subsetting Data](http://www.statmethods.net/management/subset.html)

Select the first 100 rows of a dataset and assign the information to a new object `bgm`:

```{r}
library("sampling")
data(belgianmunicipalities)
bgm <- belgianmunicipalities[1:100,]
```

Select only the entries for the first province:

```{r}
bgm1 <- belgianmunicipalities[
  belgianmunicipalities$Province==1,]
```


Select only Communes with a total population bigger than 20000:

```{r}
bgm20 <- belgianmunicipalities[
  belgianmunicipalities$Tot04>20000,]
```


## Merging

If you are not sure on the usage of a command, it is always useful to have a look at the help page of the command. E.g. we need to use the command `merge` to combine datasets. There is a section `Example` at the end of each helpfile. You get the helpfile with:

```{r,eval=F}
?merge
```

There you will find code which can be copy-pasted to the console:

Use the following lines of code to produce a `data.frame` authors:

```{r}
authors <- data.frame(
    surname = I(c("Tukey", "Venables", "Tierney", "Ripley", "McNeil")),
    nationality = c("US", "Australia", "US", "UK", "Australia"),
    deceased = c("yes", rep("no", 4)))
```

Use the following lines of code to produce a `data.frame` books:

```{r}
books <- data.frame(
    name = I(c("Tukey", "Venables", "Tierney",
             "Ripley", "Ripley", "McNeil", "R Core")),
    title = c("Exploratory Data Analysis",
              "Modern Applied Statistics ...",
              "LISP-STAT",
              "Spatial Statistics", "Stochastic Simulation",
              "Interactive Data Analysis",
              "An Introduction to R"),
    other.author = c(NA, "Ripley", NA, NA, NA, NA,
                     "Venables & Smith"))
```

Merge the do `data.frames` authors and books:

```{r}
m1 <- merge(authors, books, by.x = "surname", by.y = "name")
```


```{r,eval=F}
head(m1)
```

```{r,echo=F}
kable(head(m1))
```


## A first example dataset

The first example dataset is a synthetic example. For more information on the generation of this dataset see the r-code [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BernStZi/SamplingAndEsimation/master/excercise/rcode/SampEst_GenerateExdata.R).

```{r}
link <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BernStZi/
SamplingAndEsimation/master/excercise/data/my.pop.csv"

my.pop <- read.csv(link)
```

```{r,eval=F}
head(my.pop)
```

```{r,echo=F}
kable(head(my.pop))
```

The dollar sign can also be used to access the columns

```{r}
head(my.pop$gender)
```

With the command `table` we get a contingency table:

```{r}
table(my.pop$gender)
```

With `prop.table` we get the relative frequencies:

```{r}
tabA <- table(my.pop$gender)
prop.table(tabA)
```

## Apply family

Apply functions over array margins, ragged arrays or lists. To show that we first need an example data set:

```{r}
ApplyDat <- cbind(1:4,runif(4),rnorm(4))
```

To compute the mean for every row, we can use the `apply` command. 

```{r}
apply(ApplyDat,1,mean)
```

Mean for every column:

```{r}
apply(ApplyDat,2,mean)
```


## Simple Example on Sampling

Summary of the dataset:

```{r}
summary(my.pop)
prop.table(table(my.pop$gender,my.pop$education))
var(my.pop$iq)*(nrow(my.pop)-1)/nrow(my.pop)
```

In the following example two simple random samples are drawn, one with replacement and one without replacement:

```{r}
s.SRS <- sample(1:nrow(my.pop),500,replace=T)
s.SRSWOR <- sample(1:nrow(my.pop),500,replace=F)
```


```{r}
my.samp.SRS <- my.pop[s.SRS,]
my.samp.SRSWOR <- my.pop[s.SRSWOR,]
summary(my.samp.SRS)
```

Making graphics to compare the samples:

```{r}
plot(density(my.pop$iq),main = "My first density plot"
     , xlab = "IQ")
abline(v=mean(my.pop$iq), col = "black")
lines(density(my.samp.SRS$iq),col = "red",lwd=2)
lines(density(my.samp.SRSWOR$iq),col = "blue",lwd=2)
```

The package `sampling` is very useful to draw samples. An introduction to the package can be found [here](http://home.lu.lv/~pm90015/workshop2006/papers/presentations/W2006_Presentation_27_Tille.pdf).

```{r,warning=F}
library("sampling")
s.SRS1 <- srswr(500,nrow(my.pop))
s.SRSWOR1 <- srswor(500,nrow(my.pop)) 
my.samp.SRS1 <- rbind(my.pop[s.SRS1!=0,]
                      ,my.pop[s.SRS1>1,])
my.samp.SRSWOR1 <- my.pop[s.SRSWOR1==1,]
```

```{r}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
plot(density(my.pop$iq),main = "My first density plot"
     , xlab = "IQ")
abline(v=mean(my.pop$iq), col = "black")
lines(density(my.samp.SRS$iq),col = "red",lwd=2)
lines(density(my.samp.SRSWOR$iq),col = "blue",lwd=2)
```

```{r}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
plot(density(my.pop$iq),main = "My second density plot"
     , xlab = "IQ")
abline(v=mean(my.pop$iq), col = "black")
lines(density(my.samp.SRS1$iq),col = "red",lwd=2)
lines(density(my.samp.SRSWOR1$iq),col = "blue",lwd=2)
```

- should yield same results
- routine may differ because of "starting point"
